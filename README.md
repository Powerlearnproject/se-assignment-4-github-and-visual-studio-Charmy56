Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
1. GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Alternatively, It is a website that hosts git repositories on a remote server(kamau,2024)

- Primary Functions and features
a. Repositories: A GitHub repository contains all of the project files (including documentation) and stores each file’s revision history. They can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
b. Forks: This feature allows you to create a copy of someone else’s repository to your GitHub account. This is useful for proposing changes to someone else’s project or using someone else’s project as a starting point for your own idea.
C. Pull Requests: They are used to tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the base branch.
d. Issues: GitHub issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team.
e. GitHub Actions: It helps you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues.
 - How GitHub supports collaborative software development
  By providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where team members easily fork or clone repositories to a local machine.

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
A GitHub repository, is a centralized location on GitHub where you can store and manage your code, files, and project data.
- How to create a new Repository
 you sign in to your GitHub account.
In the top right corner, click the plus sign (+) and select "New repository".
Enter a name for your repository. This will be the name of the folder that your repository is stored in on GitHub.
Optionally, add a description for your repository. This will help other people understand what your repository is for.
Select whether your repository should be public or private. Public repositories can be seen by anyone on the internet. Private repositories can only be seen by people who you have invited to collaborate on the repository.
Optionally, initialize it with a README.md file(Immanuel,2020)
Click "Create repository".

 How GitHub enhances version control
 - GitHub enhances version control by providing a web-based graphical interface and access control,  with several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. It also offers the ability to fork projects, send pull requests, and manage changes from multiple contributors more efficiently.(Saloman,2023)

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?
Debugging in Visual Studio:

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?
Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

Discuss how GitHub and Visual Studio can be used together to support collaborative development. Provide a real-world example of a project that benefits from this integration.
